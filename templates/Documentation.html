    <h5>Signal peptide peptidase-like 2A (SPPL2A)</h5>
    <p>SPPL2A ia a intramembrane-cleaving aspartic protease (I-CLiP) that cleaves type II membrane signal peptides in the hydrophobic plane of the membrane. It plays an important role in FASLG, ITM2B and TNF processing (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16829951/">16829951</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16829952/">16829952</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17557115/">17557115</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17965014/">17965014</a>). It catalyzes the intramembrane cleavage of the anchored fragment of shed TNF-alpha (TNF), which promotes the release of the intracellular domain (ICD) for signaling to the nucleus (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16829952/">16829952</a>).It is also responsible for the intramembrane cleavage of Fas antigen ligand FASLG, which promotes the release of the intracellular FasL domain (FasL ICD) (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17557115/">17557115</a>). SPPL2A may play a role in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16829952/">16829952</a>) and can catalyze the intramembrane cleavage of the simian foamy virus envelope glycoprotein gp130 independently of prior ectodomain shedding by furin or furin-like proprotein convertase (PC)-mediated cleavage proteolysis (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23132852/">23132852</a>). </p> <br>

    <h5>Signal peptide peptidase-like 2B (SPPL2B)</h5>
    <p>SPPL2B is a transmembrane, aspartic endopeptidase that performs regulated intramembrane proteolysis of type II transmembrane proteins (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28624439/">28624439</a>). It is primarily expressed at the cell surface (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21896273/">21896273</a>). It is known to cleave tumour necrosis factor alpha at multiple sites, releasing an intracellular domain that moves to the nucleus and triggers interleukin-12 production (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16829951/">16829951</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16829952/">16829952</a>). Other proteins are also cleaved by SPPL2B, including the membrane stubs of transferrin receptor 1, the British dementia protein 2 and neuroregulin 1 following the shedding of the ectodomain mediated by other peptidases such as ADAM-10 and BACE-1 (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23384347/">23384347</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17965014/">17965014</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26574544/">26574544</a>).</p> <br>

    <h5>Beta-secretase 1 (BACE1)</h5>
    <p>BACE1 has broad endopeptidase specificity. It is responsible for the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). It cleaves at the N-terminus of the A-beta peptide sequence, between residues 671 and 672 of APP, leads to the generation and extracellular release of beta-cleaved soluble APP, and a corresponding cell-associated C-terminal fragment which is later released by gamma-secretase (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10656250/">10656250</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10677483/">10677483</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20354142/">20354142</a>). It also cleaves neural cell adhesion molecule close homolog of L1 (CHL1) (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22988240/">22988240</a>).</p> <br>

    <h5>Cathepsin K (CTSK)</h5>
    <p>CTSK is a thiol protease involved in osteoclastic bone resorption and may participate partially in the disorder of bone remodeling. It displays potent endoprotease activity against fibrinogen at acid pH and possibly plays an important role in extracellular matrix degradation. It is involved in the release of thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4) by limited proteolysis of TG/thyroglobulin in the thyroid follicle lumen (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11082042/">11082042</a>). The enzyme has broad proteolytic activity. </p> <br>

    <h5>Legumain (LGMN)</h5>
    <p>LGMN has a strict specificity for hydrolysis of asparaginyl (N) bonds (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11085925/">11085925</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18377911/">18377911</a>). However, it can also cleave aspartyl bonds slowly, especially under acidic conditions (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9821970/">9821970</a>). The enzyme is required for normal lysosomal protein degradation in renal proximal tubules and normal degradation of internalized EGFR. It plays a role in the regulation of cell proliferation via its role in EGFR degradation. It may also be involved in the processing of proteins for MHC class II antigen presentation in the lysosomal/endosomal system. </p> <br> 

    <h5>Cathepsin O (CTSO)</h5>

    <h5>Carboxypeptidase Q (CPQ)</h5>
    <p>CPQ may play an important role in the hydrolysis of circulating peptides. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of dipeptides with unsubstituted terminals into amino acids and may play a role in the liberation of thyroxine hormone from its thyroglobulin (Tg) precursor. </p> <br>

    <h5>Lysosomal Pro-X carboxypeptidase (PRCP)</h5>
    <p>PRCP cleaves C-terminal amino acids linked to proline in peptides such as angiotensin II, III and des-Arg9-bradykinin. This cleavage occurs at acidic pH, but enzymatic activity is retained with some substrates at neutral pH.</p> <br>

    <h5>Tripeptidyl-peptidase 1 (TPP1)</h5>
